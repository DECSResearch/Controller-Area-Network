# Controller-Area-Network

This repository contains Python scripts to perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks on Controller Area Network (CAN) datasets. For reference, a 2015 Nissan Altima CAN dataset is included as a CSV for students to perform statistical and exploratory data analyses (EDA) as well as exploring avenues for further research using machine learning. 

The works in this repository have been curated and created by Niroop Sugunaraj under the guidance of Dr. Prakash Ranganathan during his affiliation with DECS.
