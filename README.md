# Controller-Area-Network

This repository contains Python scripts to perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks on Controller Area Network (CAN) datasets. For reference, a 2015 Nissan Altima CAN dataset is included as a CSV for students to perform statistical and exploratory data analyses (EDA) as well as exploring avenues for further research using machine learning. The dataset can be found here: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIe7DNBenWXk8UIwyNdMglwEb422lbkn/view?usp=drive_link). 


The works in this repository have been curated and created by Niroop Sugunaraj under the guidance of Dr. Prakash Ranganathan during his affiliation with DECS.
